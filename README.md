# LoanDefault-Prediction

This is the code for "Intro to Statistics - Data Lit #2 by Siraj Raval on Youtube at School of AI. 

# Coding Challenge - Due Date, Feb 9, 12 PM PST 

Create a Jupyter notebook with a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis report of this lending club data. Make sure to use the 3 key statistical concepts i mentioned in the video (statistical features, probability distributions, and bayesian stats). Submit your github link in the comments section of the [video](https://youtu.be/MdHtK7CWpCQ). I'll give the winner a shoutout in a week!
